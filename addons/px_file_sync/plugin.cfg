name="PxFileSync"
description="Syncs .px files from an external folder (e.g. iCloud Drive) into the project while preserving folder structure. 
Uses atomic writes to avoid partial imports. 

IMPORTANT: If using iCloud on Windows, enable “Always keep on this device” for the source folder to prevent crashes caused by placeholder files.

Usage:
Set up a source folder via Project > Tools > PX Sync > Set Source...
Then just press ctrl + shift + alt + Y to sync.
